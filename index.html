      <p>1. Scope and Topics</p>
      <p>This workshop aims to explore the potential of large language models to revolutionize the way we interact with multimodal information. A large language model is a type of artificial intelligence model designed to understand and generate natural language text. With the increasing amount of multimodal information such as audio, visual, and text data generated, there is a growing need of leveraging large generative language model for multimodal applications. Recently, a few notable multimodal models with a combination of large language models significantly enhanced their understanding and generate more accurate and nuanced responses. The workshop will provide an opportunity for researchers, practitioners, and industry professionals to explore the latest trends and best practices in the field of multimodal applications of large generative models. We also remark that the submissions are not limited to use such models.</p>
      <p>In summary, the workshop will cover a wide range of topics including but not limited to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Multimodal content creation</li>
        <li>Multimodal data analysis and understanding</li>
        <li>Multimodal question answering</li>
        <li>Multimodal information retrieval</li>
        <li>Multimodal recommendation</li>
        <li>Multimodal summarization and text generation</li>
        <li>Multimodal conversational agents</li>
        <li>Multimodal machine translation</li>
        <li>Multimodal fusion and integration of information</li>
        <li>Multimodal applications/pipelines</li>
        <li>Multimodal systems management and indexing</li>      
      </ul>
      <p>2. Submission Guidelines</p>
